          <div class="column2"><p class="p1p2"> In New York City, two rival gangs have a prolonged and violent standing feud. Theese two gangs co-exist under the harsh and imposing eye of the New York Police Department, but the hatred between the two gangs threatens all, in particular the younger generations. 
                
            The young men of both gangs are hot-blooded and ready to fight out their differences through hip hop freestyle rapping and dancing, despite the Police imposing harsh prison sentences against such fights. But when young Romeo, a boy from one street gang, first sets eyes on the beautiful Juliet, no enmity between gangs can prevent them falling in love. 
            
            From this risk-laden romance comes both joy and tragedy for all.</p>

            <p class="p2p2">Passion - doomed, romantic passion in particular - lies at the heart of Romeo & Juliet. The play is about what people will sacrifice for passion and love. This production has recaptured a feeling a doomed love. 

                 The chemistry between Romeo and Juliet makes it hard to believe these two are doomed and that they end up dying for that love.

                 Romeo & Juliet is among the English language's best-known love stories and there's no shortage of adaptions available on stage, TV, and film. Those tackling this adaptation have found a way to make it stand out. This stage production has put its own stamp on the tragedy and created something that will endure for a generation. This is a big and excplosive stage production that will leave people wanting more. Viewers are invested in the characters, music, dance and their situations. Unlike many Shakespeare adaptations, this one will not sbe relegated by history to the stable of average, barely remembered iterations.</p></div>
